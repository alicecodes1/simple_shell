.TH CUSTOM_SHELL 1 "25 April 2023" "1.0" "custom man page"
.SH NAME
.B Custom Shell
- a simple command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Custom Shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
Custom shell is a command language interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them. Its functionality is limited to certain shell built-in functions found in the environmental variable
.I PATH.
Custom shell does not support piping, redirection, pattern matching, variable expansions, and other advanced features.
.SS Invocation
Custom shell can be invoked in
.I interactive
mode by typing ./custom_shell. It can also be invoked in
.I non-interactive
mode by using a pipe (e.g. echo "/bin/ls" | ./custom_shell).
.SS Command Execution
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.
.sp
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, the function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.
.sp
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, the custom shell searches each element of the environmental variable PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the custom shell prints an error message "Error: File or description not found."
